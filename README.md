# Smart-Chatbot

🚀 Just Built a Conversational AI Chatbot using Google Gemini & LangChain! 🤖💬

I'm excited to share my latest project — a smart, memory-enabled chatbot powered by Gemini 1.5 Flash, LangChain, and Streamlit!

🔍 What it does:
Understands and remembers user input (like your name or previous messages)
Supports natural, context-aware conversations
Built with LangChain’s memory architecture for persistent interaction
Secured with API key handling and deployed through a clean Streamlit interface

💡 Key Tech Stack:
🌐 Google Generative AI (Gemini 1.5 Flash)
🧠 LangChain (memory, chat history, prompt chaining)
📺 Streamlit (frontend and UI deployment)
🔐 Secure environment variable handling
